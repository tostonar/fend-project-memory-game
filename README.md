# Memory Game Project

This memory game is a card game in which all of the cards are laid face down and two cards are flipped face up over each turn. The object of the game is to turn over pairs of matching cards. This project provides an opportunity to create this game using JavaScript.

## Instructions

This game can be played in any modern browser. This game will test your memory. The player's goal is to match all the cards in as few moves as possible. Clicking on a card will reveal the image underneath. If the player matches a pair of cards, the cards will remain shown. If the player has a pair of cards that don't match, the cards will turn back over. The player starts out with 3 stars, but the stars will decrease as the player makes more moves. The game is over when all the cards have been matched.

## Built With
